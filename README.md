    The bot can now push automated pull requests, code reviews and issues.

    That means you can now have a green contribution history and a diamond contribution chart!

    It's called Green Mode and it costs $10/mo, two cups coffees per month :P

    Thank you for supporting me chasing my dream, that of living by doing what I love most, it means the world to me <3
